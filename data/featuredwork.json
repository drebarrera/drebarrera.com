    "challenge": "According to the US Census Bureau, people of Latino or Hispanic ethnicity make up 19.1% of the United States population. However, 1 out of every 6 of the Hispanic-identifying citizens live under the poverty line and Latinos make up only 8% of the tech workforce (Pew Research Center). With such a large disparity between Latinos and the promising US tech industry, the Hispanic population is in need of resources, community, and opportunities for advancement.",
    "solution": "Elevating the Latino community in tech is where Hispanic Hackers shines. I am the president of the 2400 member 501(c)(3) non-profit which offers events, resources, and community to Latinos/Hispanics in the tech industry. As the president, I inherited an 8-year old group and turned it into a federally recognized organization. We are constantly forming new partnerships, providing a safe space for Latino voices, and creating new resources for our community. To support the organization, I am leading a team of developers, designers, and leaders to build our portfolio for change.",
    "choices": "Hispanic Hackers is the central resource for Latino tech in Austin and beyond. As such, we are partnered with mutliple local and global organizations to provide representation and opportunities to our community. In terms of media and branding, I have led the efforts to market Hispanic Hackers to a wider audience, providing community for developers, entrepreneurs, and all Latino innovators. We are upgrading our website to a Next.js website with Tailwind CSS and React components. As we continue to grow, we hope to be able to provide a wider range of online resources including a member database, business information, and connections to our partnering organizations.",
    "result": "As we continue to grow, we find more and more resources to provide to our community and are planning to expand with new initiatives for Latinos in the United States and LATAM. More information on our upcoming events can be found at the website given above. The below images are website designs I created that are a work in progress for revitalizing our online presence. Because my time is stretched thin, I am bringing on other developers and designers to enhance the appearance and growth of Hispanic Hackers. As a leader, I hope to elevate the Latino tech community to new heights."

As a Fathom5 software engineer, I had the pleasure of working on the CEC Next team of two dedicated software engineers.",
    "challenge": "This project had the goal of modernizing the US Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system. As shown in the figure to the left, CEC is a system crucial to tactical tracking and engagement by collecting, aggregating, and controlling both local and networked data on warships, jets, and sensors. For example, by aggregating entity position data from different sources and vantage points, a strategically placed asset is able to better address an adversary entity. Although a powerful mechanism, the software responsible for CEC data aggregation was programmed in the 1990s and is due for an update.",
    "solution": "To demonstrate modernization capability of the CEC system, myself and a colleague applied containerization techniques to a program representing the current CEC software. This process converted the C++ program monolith into a set of microservices with telemetry capabilities. To simulate data into the program, a simulator with the capabilities of recording and outputting data over a network was programmed in Golang. Telemetry is collected by a Golang program and aggregated in a Prometheus database. The image to the right represents the program's custom UI, taking aggregated telemetry at different endpoints and displaying with Grafana.",
    "choices": "Containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, the C++ and Golang microservices communicate over an internal network using the RTI DDS publisher/subscriber messaging service by Real-Time Innovations. Telemetry collected through an external Golang microservice is aggregated by Prometheus and displayed on a Grafana dashboard. Machine processing metrics are collected using Node Exporter, providing CPU and Memory usage. The Grafana dashboard is edited using a JavaScript plugin to produce custom graphics.",
    "result": "The US Navy was impressed with the project outcome, which simulated data, sent it to a containerized parser, and interfaced state data between a set of threaded functions. Data throughput was recorded and compared for both the monolithic and microservice versions of the program using the Telemetry engine. This verified the performance of a modernized system to the customer."

    "challenge": "The electric vehicle industry is a fast evolving one. As the industry continues to grow, I have had the pleasure of completing several projects in electric vehicle embedded systems technology, combining both firmware and electrical design. Two of these projects related to distinct yet interconnected domains: the design of an innovative electrical circuit and firmware for a motorcycle with a mechanically modernized transmission system, and the creation of a rover capable of performing repetitive tasks in various repeat process environments. Both projects required cutting-edge solutions that would set new standards in efficiency, performance, and adaptability.",
    "solution": "Solutions for these projects involved a holistic approach that seamlessly integrated various technologies. For the motorcycle, a state-of-the-art EV Systems Architecture was designed, optimized for telemetry and efficiency, and integrated with the modern transmission system. The rover required a modular and scalable embedded system, equipped with advanced algorithms to enable autonomous learning and task optimization. The image to the left shows the mechatronics processes for the Repeat Rover project.",
    "choices": "Both projects involved coinciding sets of technology such as the KiCAD electric design suite, Solidworks for modeling custom mechanical components, and C++ as the basic language for providing microcontroller instructions. While the motorcycle project used prototyping controllers such as Arduino and Beagle Bone, the rover project was controlled by a Nordic nRF52 chip with custom firmware mounted on a custom PCB. The motorcycle interfaced with a custom set of microchips to interact with the CANBUS, read real-time wheel speed data from the ABS system, and assert motor shifting with asynchronous motors. The rover, on the other hand, used a custom set of reluctors and hall effect sensors, an accelerometer, and bluetooth to recieve and compute instructions. Realtime telemetry and testing UI were programmed with Node.js and JavaScript for both projects.",
    "result": "The combined result of both projects demonstrated an advancement in both the automotive and robotics industries. The data collected from the motorcycle with a modernized transmission system proved significant growth in the future of the EV industry, setting new standards in performance. Simultaneously, the rover's intelligent design enabled it to function in repeat process environments, showcasing the potential for further innovation in automation and robotics."

The challenge was to create a website and brand content that would not only reflect the startup's cutting-edge technology but also engage users and potential clients. The project required a blend of aesthetic appeal, functionality, and a clear representation of the brand's unique value proposition",
    "solution": "Solving Alpen Aerial's branding needs involved a comprehensive approach to building a website that would serve as the startup's digital storefront. This included creating a visually appealing design that resonated with the brand's active and innovative spirit, developing interactive features to showcase the panoramic tours, and crafting compelling content that communicated the startup's mission and services. Collaboration with the startup's team ensured alignment with their vision and goals.",
    "choices": "This project involved a mix of web programming with WebGen, Python, and JavaScript as well as Wix and Wix Velo development. In addition to producing website content for the company, I programmed embedded webpages for client panoramic tours. In order to produce effective tours for diverse industries, I worked closely with clients and highlighted the parts of their projects which were of greatest value to their goals. Alpen Aerial is an active and exciting company with a mission to capture the extremes of the world and human capability. My branding strategy emulated the company's tenactiy to create innovatively beautiful products.",
