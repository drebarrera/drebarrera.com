As a Fathom5 software engineer, I had the pleasure of working on the CEC Next team of two dedicated software engineers.",
    "challenge": "CEC Next has the goal of modernizing the US Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system. As shown in the figure to the left, CEC is a system crucial to tactical tracking and engagement by collecting, aggregating, and controlling both local and networked data on warships, jets, and sensors. By aggregating entity position data from multiple different sources and vantage points, for example, a strategically placed asset is able to better address an adversary entity. However, developed in the 1990s, the software responsible for data aggregation is due for an update.",
    "solution": "To demonstrate modernization capability of the system, my two-developer team applied containerization techniques to a number of threaded subprocesses representing the subprocesses of the CEC software."
